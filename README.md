```

## Usage

To start the app locally:

```sh
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

Once started, the application will run locally on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Interacting with the App

Here's how you can interact with the app:

### 1. **Search for GIFs**:
   - Type a keyword in the **search bar** and press **Enter** or wait for the debounce (1 second) to kick in.
   - GIF results related to your search term will be displayed.

### 2. **Trending GIFs**:
   - On page load, the app will display **trending GIFs** to get you started.
   - You can explore what's currently popular in GIFs without typing anything in the search bar.

### 3. **Previous Searches**:
   - Below the search bar, you will see **chips** representing your **recent searches**.
   - Click on any chip to perform that search again quickly.

### 4. **Copy URL to Clipboard**:
   - Each GIF has a **"Copy URL"** button.
   - Click this button to **copy the URL** of the GIF to your clipboard so you can easily share it with others.

### 5. **Loader During Debounce**:
   - When typing in the search bar, you will see a **loading indicator** during the debounce period, letting you know that the app is processing your input.

### 6. **Error Handling**:
   - If the **API rate limit** is exceeded, the app will display an appropriate error message.
   - Other errors, such as connectivity issues, are also handled to ensure a smooth user experience.
